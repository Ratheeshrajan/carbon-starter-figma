      # Carbon Figma Developer Guidelines

      ## Workflow

      1. Ensure details of Figma element to be implemented has been provided
      2. Collect details about the element from the Figma MCP
      3. Determine best implementation location, confirm with the user if needed
      4. Ensure full understand of the design and carbon implementation
      5. Look for annotations that may be relevant to the implementation
      6. Validate implementation using Browser tool to check live environment side-by-side comparison with Figma image
      7. Before completing the task, check with user that the implementation is correct

      ### Example Implementation Workflow

      **Scenario: Implementing Carbon table**

      1. **Initial Assessment**
         - Review Figma design (nodeId: 123:456)
         - Identify Carbon DataTable as base component
         - Note custom sorting indicators and row highlighting

      2. **Implementation Planning**
         - Determine best implementation location
         - Identify required props and state management
         - Plan responsive behavior adaptations

      3. **Code Implementation**
         - Create component files following project structure
         - Implement base functionality
         - Add custom styling or behavior based on user input or figma annotations

      4. **Validation**
         - Browser testing across breakpoints
         - Verify against Figma design using side-by-side comparison

      ## Tools & Knowledge

      - Always attempt to use Figma MCP as the source of truth for the designs
      - Use Context7 MCP to gain further insights into Carbon design system
      - Try to understand the code base structure before starting to implement
      - Check for similar components in the codebase before creating a new one
      - recommend better implementation locations if needed

      ## Frameworks & Libraries

      - Use Carbon V11
      - Use the Carbon 2x Grid for placing elements on the screen
      - Prefer the new Grid to the legacy Flex Grid
      - Match frameworks & libraries defined in the project e.g. React

      ## Guidelines for Figma Integration

      Always attempt to create pixel perfect implementations based on the provided Figma designs.
      Use `get_image` and `Browser` tools to verify the implementation.
      Make sure to ask clarifying questions about the design and location of the implementation.
      **Remeber**: Don't use positive language about the changes until you are 100% sure it matches the design and user expectations

      When integrating Figma designs with this codebase:

      1. **Component Mapping**:
          - Map Figma components to existing Carbon components where possible using `get_code` & `get_code_connect_map`
          - Follow the existing component structure and naming conventions

      2. **Theme Consistency**:
          - Use Carbon Design System tokens for colors, spacing, and typography
          - Ensure designs support both light and dark themes
          - Match current theme implementation for consistent theming

      3. **Responsive Design**:
          - Design components to work with Carbon's responsive grid system
          - Use Carbon's breakpoint mixins for responsive styles
          ```scss
          @include breakpoint-down('lg') {
            margin-inline-start: 0;
          }
          ```
        - Responsive grid system with Carbon's Grid and Column components:
          ```jsx
          <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={8}>
            {/* Content */}
          </Column>
          ```

      4. **SCSS or CSS Implementation**:
          - Follow the existing styling module pattern
          - Use the `cs--` prefix for custom component classes or existing project prefixes
          - Use BEM-like naming for component elements
          - New styles should use existing file or create new files using project structure
          - Always use Carbon design tokens for colors, spacing...
          - Use `get_variable_defs` to make sure correct value are used

      5. **Icon Usage**:
          - Use Carbon icons from `@carbon/icons-react` where possible

        ```jsx
        import { ArrowRight } from '@carbon/icons-react';

        // Used in components
        <Button renderIcon={ArrowRight}>Clone the template</Button>
        ```

      6. **Content**:
          - Follow the IBM carbon writing guidelines  
          - IBM writing is sentence case for almost everything outside of proper names.
            A common exception are product names which are usually written in title case.
          - Example: "Select your option", not "Select Your Option"
            but: "Watson Code Assistant" as it is a product name.

      ## Troubleshooting Guide

      ### Common Implementation Challenges

      1. **Design Discrepancies**
         - When Figma measurements don't match Carbon's spacing tokens
         - Solution: Use closest Carbon token, document decision

      2. **Component Limitations**
         - When Carbon component doesn't support a design feature
         - Solution: Consider composition approach or feature request

      3. **Responsive Breakpoints**
         - When design only shows desktop or mobile view
         - Solution: Apply Carbon's responsive principles to interpolate missing breakpoints

      4. **Theme Inconsistencies**
         - When design uses non-standard colors
         - Solution: Map to nearest theme token, consult with designer

      ### Debugging Process

      1. Use browser inspector to compare rendered output with Figma specs
      2. Check for CSS specificity issues when styles aren't applying
      3. Verify Carbon component props and configuration
      4. Use React DevTools to inspect component hierarchy
      5. Use linting tools to catch common mistakes
      6. Use diagnostics or terminal output to check for errors
      7. If unsure ask the user for more information if the results are not as expected
